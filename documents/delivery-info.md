# Delivery Information

## Please Note

- Due to a large volume of orders, Performance Meal Prep will NOT refund orders delivered past our deadline.
- We ask that you order five (5) items for delivery.
- Traffic and weather conditions may interfere with routes.

We cannot meet specific delivery times. Our routes change every week. Food will be delivered in the order which our routing system processes address information. If you would like your food delivered at a certain time, feel free to include a note at checkout. We will do our best to accommodate any requests.

## Delivery Charges

Delivery charges are determined by distance. There are four zones for delivery. PMP delivers within a 50-mile radius of our production facility. Charges are as follows:

- ZONE 1 = $6.75
- ZONE 2 = $8.50
- ZONE 3 = $10.00
- ZONE 4 = $12.00
- Extended range = $20.00 

If you are in New Jersey or Delaware, depending on your location in either state there may be an added fee. This is put in place to calculate toll roads.
